# Optimal Mixture of Gaussians for Depth Fusion
Implementation of the filter proposed in:

Probabilistic RGB-D Odometry based on Points, Lines and Planes Under Depth Uncertainty, P. Proen√ßa and Y. Gao, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04034

The OMG filter is aimed at denoising the depth maps given by a depth sensor, hole-filling, but also (more importantly) capturing the depth uncertainty though spatio-temporal observations, which proved to be useful as an input to a probabilistic visual odometry system.
